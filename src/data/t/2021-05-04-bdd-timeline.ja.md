# Background and Motivation

I'm not so crucial about TDD, BDD nor an ritual practitioner of them. Even so I occasionally come up with an idea that TDD or BDD must be suited to the issues I encountered sometimes.

This time I wish to be a little more thoughtful. I've collected important events in TDD and Agile field, and sorted them chronologically so I can capture a brief history and trend of TDD, BDD or ATDD.
