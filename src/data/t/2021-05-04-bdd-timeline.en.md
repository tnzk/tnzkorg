# Background and Motivation

I'm not so crucial about BDD, nor an ritual practitioner of it. Even so I occasionally come up with an idea that BDD must be suited to the issues I encountered sometimes.

This time I wish to be a little more thoughtful. I've collected the important events in BDD and Agile field, and sorted them chronologically so I can grasp a brief history and trend of TDD, BDD and ATDD.
